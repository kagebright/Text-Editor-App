# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor App

A text editor application that runs in the browser as a single-page application and meets the PWA criteria. It features data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline. The app uses idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data.
